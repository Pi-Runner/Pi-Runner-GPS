# Pi-Runner-GPS
Raspberry Pi Zero based GPS tracker for runners
Newbie to coding and Python, so please be nice...
Trying to build a raspberry pi zero based GPS tracker that will track cumulatitive miles run.  Building on MattRichardson's PiZero Tracker.
Each mile travelled will trigger a Tweet to Twitter followers, showing progress, i.e. ran 1 mile, 2 miles, etc.
Goal is to use this in a marathon run to help spread the word about raspberry pi zero projects and integration of computing with outdor activities.
